   ```

2. Install the dependencies

## Development

### Database

The application uses a PostgreSQL database for storing data. You can use Docker to run these services locally.

```bash
docker-compose -f ./dev-docker-compose.yaml up
docker-compose -f ./dev-docker-compose.yaml up -d # if you want the db to run in the background
```

Close the database with:

```bash
docker-compose -f ./dev-docker-compose.yaml down
```

### Prisma

The application uses Prisma to interact with the database.

### UI

The application uses [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com) to build the UI components. It also uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.
